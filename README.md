# ZenKivy

ZenKivy is a project that aims to provide spontaneous Kivy consulting, training,
support and prototyping services.

## The Zen of Kivy

[Kivy](http://kivy.org) is a free, Open Source, cross-platform Python framework
for delivering responsive, cross-platform, multi-touch applications to desktops
and mobile devices.

Zen is about being one. One code-base. All platforms. Simple. Beautiful.

## Offerings

We offer the following services:
* Answering questions around Kivy and it's usage 
* Guidance and advice on Kivy projects
* Development and feature additions to Open prototypes
* Talks, presentations and adoption proposals 

Note that we can in no way guarantee response times or availability. These
services are given freely and without expectation. We hope for the same in
return.

## Motives

This project is inspired out of gratitude for Kivy and all [it's sister projects
](http://github.com/kivy/).

Kivy offers a great solution for 'run anywhere' apps that provide native,
hardware accelerated graphics. It provides a platform agnostic code-base, yet
allows for calling native OS functions if required. Whether it's Android API's
via [pjnius](https://github.com/kivy/pyjnius), iOS calls via [pjobjus](
https://github.com/kivy/pyobjus) or Win32 APi calls via [PyWin32](
https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/), Kivy lets you do it all.

## Conditions

In return for these services, we ask simply that you use Kivy respectfully and
contribute back to the project appropriately.

This can be defined more clearly as:
* Reporting any demonstrable issues via the official [Kivy issue tracker](
  https://github.com/kivy/kivy/issues). The issue report should, where possible,
  include an minimal, runnable example demonstrating the issue.
* Any bug fixes and improvements that are applied to Kivy for production should
  be fed back into the Kivy project via a suitably prepared [pull-request](
  https://github.com/kivy/kivy/pulls).
* Give fair credit and acknowledgement to the Kivy project where appropriate.

## How it works

To come...
